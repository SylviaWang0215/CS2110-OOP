1. write the algorithm for executing the Java assignment statement
step1. evaluate the <expression>
step2. store its value in the <variable>

2. write the algorithm for executing the Java if-statement
step1. evaluate the <boolean-expression>
step2. if <boolean-expression> is true, jump to step 3
step3. execute the <statement1>

3. write the algorithm for executing the Java if-else-statement
step1. evaluate the <boolean-expression>
step2. if <boolean-expression> is true, execute the <statement1>; otherwise execute the <statement2>

4. Tell us in a few words what you thought of the two videos, their message, and the homework
The video tells the most basic logic for executing the command in Java, and the officially way to describe the algorithm.
